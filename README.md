   - [Task A](./Problem_Set_1/Task_A): CLI tool to compute timestamp differences.
   - [Task B](./Problem_Set_1/Task_B): REST API for the same logic.
   - [Task C](./Problem_Set_1/Task_C): Dockerized multi-instance deployment.

2. **Problem Set 2**: [IPDR Data Analysis](./Problem_Set_2)  
   - Process VoIP call data to classify audio/video calls.

## Requirements
- Python 3.9+
